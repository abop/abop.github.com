title: How to Enter Special Characters in Ubuntu(Linux)
---

 > To enter a character by its code point, hold down `Ctrl` and `Shift`, type `u` followed by the four-character code point, 
then release `Ctrl` and `Shift`. If you often use characters that you can't easily access with other methods, you might find
 it useful to memorize the code point for those characters so you can enter them quickly.
